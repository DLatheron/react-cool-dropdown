## TODO List:
- Remove from list when selected;
- Add to the top of the list when selected (show the selected list at the top);
- Optimise 'isSelected' with lookup of id;
- Variable fields;
- Item rendering override;
x Click outside to close;
x Click on the entire thing to open (initially);
x Placeholder for multi select with nothing;
- Adding items;
- Toolbars with buttons to control selection;
- Toolbars with the ability to render statistics;
- Limit the number of selected items.
- Could we make it so that it only registers for the click outside IFF the dropdown is open???
- Refactor to break into sub components for easier maintenance;
- Disable searchable;
